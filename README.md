# Craig's leadership operating manual

## Disclaimer
This document only applies to myself and not other managers at Graphiq/Amazon.  Every SDM has their own style and quirks.  This doc attempts to fill you in on some of mine.

## Wat is Dis
We need to get to know each other a bit to work effectively together.  This document will help "prime the pump" and get that relationship going.  It should also make some of the most critical expectations as clear as possible early on, setting you up for success.

## My Leadership Philosophy
I am a big beleiver in servant leadership.  I exist to make it easier for you and the team to do great work.  I want you to grow as a developer, I want the team to grow in its responsibiltiites, and I want Alexa to grow because our team is successful.

## My Job
In order of decreasing importance:
1. People manager  
There is a lot going on with the people of our team.  I need to learn and know quite a bit about the personal and professional context of each individual.  This helps me guide the right projects to the right people, making each engineer maximally effective and helping them grow over time.  It also helps make this a great team to be on.

2. Project manager  
I manage all of the in-flight sprints and plan out our upcoming project roadmap.  I am contantly weighing many factors to determine project priorities.  Most times I will leave the final sprint planning to the engineers because I want to dictate the "what" and not the "how".  It is your job as an engineer to decide how we will solve the technical challenges assigned to our team.

3. Product manager  
While we have a dedicated product manager, I also do a lot of work across groups to understand how our software is used and what features/fixes should be prioritized.  I also coordinate with other team so I can more effectively prioritize our projects.

4. Software engineer  
With my last promotion I find that I am no longer doing significant software development work.  Still, I always work to stay sharp technically so I can effectively understand the challenges facing the team.  Coding is why I got in the business and I always want to keep my "hands dirty" in some way.  I often try to take care of the minor work, paving the road for you to focus on major contributions and projects.

## Empowerment
I try very hard to not be an authoritarian boss.  I want to provide a work environment where you can be creative, deliver value, and shine as an engineer.

• I believe in and practice servant leadership, meaning I serve you and not the other way around.

• Your role on the team is to ship great software to our customers.

• My role on the team is to make sure you have the skills, space, and context to do that in the best possible way

• I am also here to help you progress in your professional life, helping you achieve your personal or professional goals.
 
## I Default to High Autonomy
My default management mode is to let you handle your work without much guidance or direction from me.  

• We hired you because you are smart and capable. I trust you to know your own limits and will get support when needed.  

• I may provide suggestions, but I will try to not force a solution.

• At the end of the day, you own the code and know more about our systems than I do. I will trust your judgement.  

• Everyone is different, and I realize some engineers need more guidance than others. If you need more direction from me then please let me know as soon as possible.  

• I’ll get better at finding this balance as we get to know each other better.  Please give me feedback on this often.

## What do I value most?
Listed by Amazon Leadership Principle:  
• Customer Obsession.  
We should care deeply about how our customers use our software and what they need from us in the future.

• Insisting on Highest Standards.  
We should be delivering top-quality software at all times.  We will occasionally take on technical debt to speed things along, but at no time will we compromise our standards.

• Delivering Results. 
This is what we are here for - to deliver solutions that delight our customers and make their lives easier/better.

## What will dissapoint me?
This is pretty much the inverse of the points above:  
• Not caring about our customers or how our software impacts their work.  
• Not being invested in our software development or the team.  
• Delivering substandard software with low quality.

## Transparency
• I will work to be as open as possible about what’s going on with our team, organization, and the company.  

• My calendar is public, and very few events are private.  

• This company may require me to not tell you about something before a certain date. This has happened once in the last few years, when Graphiq got acquired.  

• This company cannot require me to lie to you. That's never happened and I've never been asked to do so. If asked, I would not do so.  

• I bias toward transparency and candor. You can ask anything. Most of the time, I'll answer. Rarely, I won't. I'm committed to never lying to you.

## Personality Quirks
Everyone has particular personality quirks.  I try to list a few of mine here so you are aware of them.

• I am very friendly and flexible, but I do have limits.  For example, need a last minute day off?  Shouldn't be an issue.  What about a string of several last-minute PTO requests?  The first few will probably be fine, but once it becomes a pattern then my irritation scales up.  I will work hard to let you know when you are close to the line so you can course-correct early.

• I can get stressed out on rare occasions, like most people.  
- When this happens, I may be seem to be in a hurry or otherwise distracted
- Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will take a step back (really)

• Sometimes I have a tendency to want to be right  
- Often I am just playing devil's advocate.  Other times, I can keep pushing a point because I think it’s right, not because it objectively is.  
- Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will reconsider my position.

• When giving feedback, I tend to skew toward the "big picture".  
This means I can sometimes omit information on specific instances or episodes of a behavior.  I have been working hard to utilize the situation/behavior/impact (SBI) framework for feedback, but it is a skill I am still developing.  If you prefer more-specific feedback then please let me know and I will adapt.

## Work Hours
• I typically work 9am-7pm.  Most of the team keeps similar hours.  I am flexible regarding when you come in, but at first you should bias toward being here when the rest of the team is around to help.

• I usually hang out around the office during lunch.  This doesn't mean that you have to.  Please, get out and enjoy the sunshine if you want.

• Work from home when you need to, but please don't abuse the priviledge.  Letting me know at least a day before tends to work best.  Please try to minize remote work at first though - you need to be around your peers to get training and assistance.

• Every member of the team will begin taking turns on-call after a few months.  We currently do seven-day oncall shifts.  You are expected to respond immediately to pages and service warnings when you are oncall.  We will review this in detail in a few months.  We will not put you oncall until you are comfortable and prepared.

## Communication
Email: I expect you to read and reply to emails _at least once per day_ during the work week.

Slack/Chime: Direct messages should be responded to _within a few hours_ during the work week.

Phone calls and pages: Urgent, expected to be answered or responded to _ASAP_ regardless of day.

• Any email/slack message I send you outside of work hours can typically be ignored until the next business day.  If I need a response more quickly, I will make a note of it in the message.

• If I call you or page you outside of business hours then it is likely an emergency.  You should get back in touch with me as soon as you can.  This should be a very rare occurrence.

• This contact policy does not apply to you contacting me. Feel free to reach me via Slack, Chime, email, SMS, whatever, whenever you need to.  If you need a response quickly then please let me know.  I am always happy to help.

## Growth/development/coaching
It is my job to help you get to where you want to go professionally, even if it means you leaving Amazon one day.  I think that this is one of the most-important aspects of my job, and we will spend a fair amount of time talking long-term.

We will have a sit-down meeting at least once per quarter to talk about your career growth.  I will also be asking some future-focused questions during our weekly 1:1 meetings.  These tend to work better when you have done some introspection on where you would like to be in 1, 2, or more years.  I can only be of service when I know how I can help.

## Feedback
I love feedback.  I feel strongly that it is super-crtiical to both your success and mine.

• Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:  
- Safety: probability of you being punished for giving feedback.  This should be low.
- Effort: the amount of work in order to give feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?".  This should be low.
- Benefit: how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior?  This should be high.

• Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions  

• I'll let you know if you don't do well on any of these three dimensions  

• I care about kindness, but I'll optimize for effectiveness and, within that optimized effectiveness, try to be as kind as possible  

• My job is to always make sure that you heard and understood the feedback I provided.

• This is something I have historically had as a growth area, and I am still working on it.  Often, I have been too kind at the expense of being effective.  If I need to be more direct then please let me know.

## Want to Talk? Let's Talk
• Uncertainty is a relationship killer.  I never, ever want you to wonder where you stand with me.  We should always default to communicating about important topics, particularly when there is a concern.

• Have a quick question?  Send me a Slack message.

• Need to have a longer discussion?  Let's talk in person, 1:1, at any time.

• Let me know that you want to chat.  I can almost always move things on my calendar to meet with you.  I am in a lot of meetings.  Very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me.

• Feel entirely free to put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want

## Weekly 1:1s
• This is your time.  While I will bring up questions and topics, you should feel free to steer the discussion as you see fit.  If I need time to talk with you about something I will schedule another meeting at another time.

• We can talk about sprint work, but that isn't really what the 1:1 is all about.

• Urgent matters should not wait for a 1:1.

• Our 1:1 meetings are currently held every week.  We can do 30, 45, 60 minutes depending on how much we have to talk about.  This is largely up to you.  I try to leave the half-hour after our 1:1 free, so we can talk as long as you need.

## New Employee Expectations
• It is expected that you will put in sufficient extra work to onboard as quickly as possible.  More than eight hours of work is sometimes expected on this team, and your first few months is one time when additional effort is required.

• You spend most of your time working around the team in the first few months.  You are going to need a lot of input from your peers at first, and that is difficult to obtain when you are sitting away from the group.

• I fully expect that ,at some point in the first three months, you will take down one of our production systems. As long as you are doing your best to avoid production errors then I will not be dissapointed by this. We run complex systems, and it takes time to learn them. My only request is that you learn from your mistakes and not make the same mistake twice.

## The Road Ahead
This is a lot to take in all at once, I know.  Still, I have high confidence in your ability to get up to speed on the team.  I wouldn't have hired you otherwise.  There are going to be plenty of bumps in the road ahead: code that makes no sense, undefined goals, a cranky sprint parter, and ineffective management on my part from time-to-time.  When this happens, we will work together to get through it and learn from the mistakes.  

## End Random Miscellany
• GIF pronunciation: I think it is "gif" not "jif".  I know the creator of GIFs says otherwise, but he is mistaken.

• Tabs vs Spaces.  Spaces, always.  This was the coding standard at every job I have worked at and is the coding standard for our team.

• Text editors.  I never got on the Emacs or Vi bandwagons.  I use BBEdit for most text work on the Mac.  I have literally used it since I was a kid.

• I have been an avid cyclist since I was a teen.  I like to do long road rides around the county and short rides up mountains.  I have been a decent runner since 2007, but I am in no way fast.

• I am a private pilot and fly small planes on the weekends.  I would be happy to take you flying around Santa Barbara if you are interested.

• I am just now getting into SCUBA diving.  The Channel Islands, visible from our office, are a wonderful place to sightsee underwater.

• I still like to do embedded programming on the weekends. I set up a LoRa radio network at my house to control lights and read sensor data.

• My communication can get meme-heavy at times. Feel free to send me funny cats at any time.
