# Craig's leadership operating manual

## Disclaimer
This document only applies to me and not other managers at Graphiq/Amazon.  Every SDM has their own style and quirks.  This doc attempts to fill you in on some of mine.

## Wat is Dis
We need to get to know each other a bit to work effectively together.  This document will help "prime the pump" and get that relationship going.  It should also make some of the most critical expectations as clear as possible.

## My Leadership Philosophy
I am a big beleiver in servant leadership.  I exist to make it easier for you and the team to do great work.  I want you to grow as a developer, I want the team to grow in its responsibiltiites, and I want Amazon to grow because our team is successful.

## My Job
In order of decreasing importance:
1. People manager  
There is a lot going on with the people of our team.  I need to learn and know quite a bit about the personal and professional context of each individual.  This helps me guide the right projects to the right people, making each engineer maximally effective.  It also helps to make this a great team to be on.

2. Project manager
I plan all the upcoming and in-flight sprints.  I am contantly weighing many factors to determine project priorities.  Most times I will leave the final sprint planning to the engineers because I want to dictate the "what" and not the "how".

3. Product manager  
We don't have a dedicated product manager, so I do a lot of work across several groups to understand how our products are used and what features/fixes should be prioritized.  I also coordinate with other groups so I can more effectively prioritize our projects.

4. Software engineer  
I still spend a significant percentage of my time doing engineering work. Coding is why I got in the business and I always want to keep my "hands dirty".  I often try to take care of the minor work, paving the road for you to focus on major contributions and projects.

## Empowerment
I am try very hard to not be an authoritarian boss.  I want to provide a work environment where you can be creative, deliver value, and shine as an engineer.

• I believe in and practice servant leadership, meaning I serve you and not the other way around.

• Your role on the team is to ship great software to our customers.

• My role on the team is to make sure you have the skills, space, and context to do that in the best possible way

• I am also here to help you progress in your professional life, helping you achieve your personal or professional goals.
 
## I Default to High Autonomy
My default management mode is to let you handle your work without much guidance or direction from me.  

• We hired you because you are smart and capable. I trust you to know your own limits and get support when needed.  

• I may provide suggestions, but I will try to not force a solution.

• At the end of the day, you own the code and know more than I do. I will trust your judgement.  

• Everyone is different, and I realize some folks need more guidance than others. If you need more direction from me then please let me know as soon as possible.  

• I’ll get better at finding this balance as we get to know each other better.

## What do I value most?
Listed by Amazon Leadership Principle:  
• Customer Obsession.  We should care deeply about how our customers use our software and what they need from us in the future.

• Insisting on Highest Standards.  We should be delivering top-quality software at all times.  We will occasionally take on technical debt to speed things along, but at no time will we compromise our standards.

• Delivering Results. This is what we are here for - to deliver solutions that delight our customers and make their lives easier.

## What will dissapoint me?
• Not caring about our customers.  
• Not being invested in the work or the team.  
• Delivering substandard software.

## Transparency
• I will work to be as open as possible about what’s going on with our team, organization, and the company.  

• My calendar is public, and very few events are private.  

• This company may require me to not tell you about something before a certain date. This has happened once in the last year, when we got acquired.  

• This company cannot require me to lie to you. That's never happened and I've never been asked to do so. If asked, I would not do so.  

• I bias toward transparency and candor. You can ask anything. Most of the time, I'll answer. Rarely, I won't. I'm committed to never lying to you.

## Personality Quirks
Everyone has particular personality quirks.  I try to list a few of mine here so you are aware of them.

• I am very friendly and flexible, but I do have limits.  For example, need a last minute day off?  Shouldn't be an issue.  What about a string of last-minute PTO requests?  The first few I will probably be fine, but once it becomes a pattern then my irritation will _dramatically_ scale up.  I will work hard to let you know when you are close to the line so you can course-correct early.

• I can get stressed out on rare occasions, like most people  
- When this happens, I may be short with you  
- Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will take a step back

• I have a tendency to want to be right  
- Sometimes I am just playing devil's advocate.  Other times, I can keep pushing a point because I think it’s right, not because it objectively is.  
- Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will reconsider my position.

• I have had problems in the past with not doing a good job sharing knowledge
- When I first started managing, I would not pass on knowledge of systems
- I would take certain pieces of complex work because it was easiest for me to do it
- This disempowers the team
- This prevents you from having the opportunity to grow
- This makes me stressed out

## Work Hours
• I typically work 9am-7pm.  Most of the team keeps similar hours.  

• I usually hang out around the office during lunch.  This doesn't mean that you have to.  Please, get out and enjoy the sunshine if you want.

• Work from home when you need to, but please don't abuse the priviledge.  Letting me know at least a day before tends to work best.

• Every member of the team will take an on-call shift.  We currently do seven-day oncall shifts.  You are expected to respond immediately to pages and service warnings during that time.

## Communication
Email: People expect you to read and reply to emails _at least once per day_ during the work week.

Slack/Chime: Direct messages should be responded to _within a few hours_ during the work week.

Phone calls and pages: Urgent, expected to be answered or responded to _ASAP_ regardless of day.

• Any email/slack message I send you outside of work hours can typically be ignored until the next business day.  If I need a response more quickly, I will make a note of it in the message.

• If I call you or page you outside of business hours then it is likely an emergency.  You should get back in touch with me as soon as you can.  This should be a very rare occurrence.

• This contact policy does not apply to you contacting me. Feel free to reach me via Slack, Chime, email, SMS, whatever, whenever you need to.  If you need a response quickly then please let me know.

## Feedback
I love feedback.  I feel strongly that it is super-crtiical to both your success and mine.

• Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:  
- Safety (unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback; should be high)  
- Effort (The amount of work in order to give feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?"; should be low)  
- Benefit (how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? should be high)  

• Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions  

• I'll let you know if you don't do well on any of these three dimensions  

• I care about kindness, but I'll optimize for effectiveness and within that optimized effectiveness try to be as kind as possible  

• My job is to make sure you got the feedback  

• This is something I historically have not been good at, and am working on it (I have been too kind at the expense of being effective)  

## Want to Talk? Let's Talk
• Uncertainty is a relationship killer.  I never, ever want you to wonder where you stand with me.  We should always default to communicating about important topics, particularly when there is a concern.

• Have a quick question?  Send me a Slack message.

• Need to have a longer discussion?  Let's talk in person, 1:1, at any time.

• Let me know that you want to chat.  I can almost always move things on my calendar to meet with you.  I am in a lot of meetings.  Very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me.

• Feel entirely free to put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want

## 1:1s
• This is your time.  While I will bring up questions and topics, you should feel free to steer the discussion as you see fit.  If I need time to talk with you about something I will schedule another meeting at another time.

• We can talk about sprint work, but that isn't really what the 1:1 is all about.

• Urgent matters should not wait for a 1:1.

• Our 1:1 meetings are currently held every week.  We can do 30, 45, 60 minutes depending on how much we have to talk about.  This is largely up to you.  I try to leave the half-hour after our 1:1 free, so we can talk as long as you need.

## New Employee Expectations
• It is expected that you will put in sufficient extra work to onboard as quickly as possible.  More than eight hours of work is sometimes expected on this team, and your first few months is one time when this is true.

• You should be at your desk working most of the time.  You are going to need a lot of input from your peers at first, and that is difficult to obtain when you are away from the group.

• New employees should only rarely work remotely.  We want you here, learning with us for a while at first.  A remote day or two isn't terrible, but generally you should be in the office.

## The Road Ahead
This is a lot to take in all at once, I know.  Still, I have high confidence in your ability to get up to speed on the team.  I wouldn't have hired you otherwise.  There are going to be plenty of bumps in the road ahead: code that makes no sense, undefined goals, a cranky sprint parter, and ineffective management on my part from time-to-time.  When this happens, we will work together to get through it and learn from the mistakes.  

## End Random Miscellany
• GIF pronunciation.  It is "gif" not "jif".  I know the creator of GIFs says otherwise, but he is sorely mistaken.

• Tabs vs Spaces.  Spaces, always.  This was the coding standard at every job I have worked at and is the coding standard for our team.

• Text editors.  I never got on the Emacs or Vi bandwagons.  I use BBEdit for most text work on the Mac.  I have literally used it since I was a kid.

• I have been an avid cyclist since I was a teen.  I like to do long road rides and short rides up mountains.  I have been a decent runner since 2007, but I am in no way fast.

• I am a private pilot and fly small planes on the weekends.  I would be happy to take you flying around Santa Barbara if you are interested.

• I am just now getting into SCUBA diving.  The Channel Islands, visible from our office, are a wonderful place to sightsee underwater.

• I like memes with cats in them.
